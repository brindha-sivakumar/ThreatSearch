# ThreatSearch — Cybersecurity Advisory Retrieval System

---

## Overview

ThreatSearch is a domain-adapted information retrieval system that lets security analysts search and rank cybersecurity threat intelligence from two public sources: the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and MITRE ATT&CK. Unlike a general-purpose search engine, ThreatSearch is built to understand security-specific language — it preserves CVE identifiers, ATT&CK technique IDs, and CWE weakness codes as atomic tokens, uses an expanded security stopword list, and expands queries using ATT&CK's own technique taxonomy.

The system extends a basic inverted index pipeline with a full retrieval stack: BM25 ranked retrieval, Boolean AND/OR/NOT query handling, ATT&CK-aware query expansion, LSA dimensionality reduction for memory-safe semantic search, and LDA topic modeling over the CVE corpus.

---
### Setup

```python
pip install nltk scikit-learn scipy numpy gensim
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
git clone https://github.com/brindha-sivakumar/ThreatSearch.git
```

### Download the datasets

#### NVD CVE feeds

```python
import os, requests

os.makedirs("data/nvd", exist_ok=True)

# Download one year as a test (add more years as needed)
years = [2021, 2022, 2023, 2024]   # adjust to your needs

for year in years:
    url  = f"https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.1/nvdcve-1.1-{year}.json.gz"
    dest = f"data/nvd/nvdcve-1.1-{year}.json.gz"
    print(f"Downloading {year}...")
    r = requests.get(url, stream=True, timeout=120)
    with open(dest, "wb") as f:
        for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
            f.write(chunk)
    print(f"  saved {os.path.getsize(dest) // 1024:,} KB")

print("NVD download complete.")
```

> **Tip:** Start with just 2021 to test the pipeline before downloading all years. Each file is 40–200 MB.

#### MITRE ATT&CK

```python
import requests, os

os.makedirs("data/attack", exist_ok=True)

url  = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitre/cti/master/enterprise-attack/enterprise-attack.json"
dest = "data/attack/enterprise-attack.json"

print("Downloading ATT&CK bundle (~75 MB)...")
r = requests.get(url, stream=True, timeout=300)
with open(dest, "wb") as f:
    for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
        f.write(chunk)
print(f"Saved {os.path.getsize(dest) // 1024:,} KB → {dest}")
```

## Running the Pipeline

---

### Phase 1 — Corpus ingestion and inverted index

**What this phase does:** Reads raw NVD JSON feeds and the ATT&CK STIX bundle, applies security-aware NLP (ID preservation, stemming, stopword filtering, acronym expansion), and builds a sharded inverted index plus a global dictionary.

**Files involved:** `ingest.py` → `nlp.py` → `index.py`

**Outputs:** `data/corpus/*.txt` (corpus shards), `data/index/dictionary.txt`, `data/index/index_*.txt`

```python
# 1a. Ingest: convert raw data to corpus shards
!python ingest.py \
    --nvd-dir data/nvd/ \
    --attack  data/attack/enterprise-attack.json \
    --out-dir data/corpus/
```

```python
# 1b. Build index: two-pass over corpus shards
#     Pass 1 → dictionary.txt (global vocabulary, word codes)
#     Pass 2 → index_*.txt   (per-shard posting lists)
!python index.py \
    --corpus-dir data/corpus/ \
    --out-dir    data/index/
```

**`ingest.py`**  
Reads NVD JSON/JSON.gz feeds and the ATT&CK STIX bundle. Extracts CVE descriptions, CWE tags, reference titles, technique names, detection notes, and platform data. Runs a pre-pass to extract structured identifiers (CVE-XXXX-XXXX, CWE-NNN, T1021.002) as atomic tokens before the regular lexer touches the text. Expands security acronyms (RCE → remotecodeexecution). Writes one corpus shard per 10,000 NVD documents plus one shard for ATT&CK.

**`nlp.py`**  
The security-aware NLP layer shared by all other components. Applies the same lexer/parser from hw1 extended with: structured ID detection (IDs bypass stemming and stopword filtering), an expanded security stopword list (words like "vulnerability", "advisory", "attacker" that appear in almost every document and add no discriminating value), Porter stemming on regular tokens, and a minimum token length filter. Every other component imports `process_line()` from this file.

**`index.py`**  
Two-pass inverted index builder. Pass 1 streams all corpus shards once to build the global vocabulary and write `dictionary.txt` — each word's line number is its word code, matching hw2's convention. Pass 2 re-streams each shard independently to build a local index file containing only terms with actual postings in that shard. Posting format: `<word-code> <word> <doc-frequency> (<doc-id>,<tf>,<source>) ...`. Includes a `verify_word_codes()` function that cross-checks every shard against the dictionary after writing.

---
### Phase 2 — Ranked retrieval and query expansion

**What this phase does:** Adds BM25 scoring over the posting lists, ATT&CK-aware query expansion (maps query terms to ATT&CK technique IDs and injects related CVEs), and Boolean AND/OR/NOT query handling. `query.py` is the unified interface for all query modes.

**Files involved:** `run_doc_lengths.py`, `expander.py`, `ranker.py`, `boolean_query.py`, `query.py`

**Outputs:** `data/index/doc_lengths.json`, `data/index/technique_cve_map.json`

```python
# 2a. Pre-compute document lengths (needed by BM25 length normalisation)
!python run_doc_lengths.py
```

```python
# 2b. Build technique→CVE map (enables CVE injection during expansion)
!python expander.py build-map
```

```python
# 2c. Run example queries

# Standard BM25 query
!python query.py "buffer overflow SMB"

# With ATT&CK expansion details
!python query.py "log4j jndi remote code execution" --explain

# Boolean AND — both terms must appear
!python query.py "smb AND windows"

# Boolean OR — either term matches
!python query.py "SMB OR RDP"

# Boolean AND NOT — exclude term
!python query.py "windows AND NOT authenticated"

# Boolean with parentheses
!python query.py "windows AND (smb OR rdp)"

# TF-IDF instead of BM25, no expansion
!python query.py "lateral movement credential" --scorer tfidf --no-expand --top 20
```

```python
# Verify the map has content
import json
with open("data/index/technique_cve_map.json") as f:
    m = json.load(f)
total = sum(len(v) for v in m.values())
print(f"{len(m)} techniques mapped to {total:,} CVEs")
```
**`run_doc_lengths.py`**  
Scans all corpus shards and computes the token count per document. Writes `doc_lengths.json`. BM25's length normalisation term requires knowing each document's length relative to the corpus average — without this file the BM25 scorer falls back to the corpus average for every document.

**`ranker.py`**  
BM25 and TF-IDF scorer. Loads posting lists lazily per query term from the index shard files and caches them in an LRU cache (capped at 2000 terms) to prevent unbounded memory growth. ATT&CK postings receive a 1.3× source weight boost since technique descriptions are higher-signal than generic CVE text. Accepts an optional `candidate_ids` set from the Boolean handler to restrict scoring to a pre-filtered document set.

**`boolean_query.py`**  
Boolean AND / OR / NOT query handler. Contains a lexer, a recursive descent parser that produces an AST, and an evaluator that applies set operations over posting sets. Supports parenthesised sub-expressions and `AND NOT` as a single operator. Returns a set of matching doc IDs that `ranker.py` uses as a candidate filter for BM25 re-ranking.

**`expander.py`**  
ATT&CK query expander. At startup, indexes every ATT&CK technique by the stemmed keywords in its name, description, detection text, and platform list. At query time, maps each query term to matching technique IDs (injected at 0.6× weight) and optionally to CVE IDs that co-occur with those techniques (injected at 0.4× weight). The `build-map` subcommand scans the corpus to build the technique→CVE mapping.

**`query.py`**  
Unified search interface. Auto-detects Boolean queries (from AND/OR/NOT keywords), strips operators before NLP processing, runs the Boolean handler if needed, then calls the expander and ranker. Supports single-query mode and interactive mode (loads the index once, much faster for multiple queries). Generates clickable NVD and ATT&CK URLs in the results output.

---

### LSA — Memory-safe semantic index

**What this phase does:** Builds a compressed latent-semantic representation of the entire corpus. Instead of growing a posting-list cache in RAM, the LSA ranker loads two fixed numpy arrays at startup and never allocates additional memory regardless of query volume. This is the OOM management approach described in the project proposal.

BM25 and LSA are complementary: BM25 is exact and fast; LSA handles synonyms and paraphrases that exact keyword matching misses. `query.py` supports both via `--scorer`.

**Files involved:** `lsa_build.py`, `lsa_ranker.py`

**Outputs:** `data/lsa_index/term_matrix.npy`, `data/lsa_index/doc_matrix.npy`, `data/lsa_index/doc_ids.json`, `data/lsa_index/words.json`

```python
# Build LSA index (5–20 min on full corpus)
# Use --components 100 for a faster test run
!python lsa_build.py --components 300
```

```python
# Query using LSA
!python lsa_ranker.py --lsa-dir data/lsa_index "buffer overflow privilege escalation"
!python lsa_ranker.py --lsa-dir data/lsa_index --explain "lateral movement SMB"
```

```python
# Memory comparison: run many queries and observe memory stays fixed
from lsa_ranker import LSARanker
ranker = LSARanker("data/lsa_index", "data/index/dictionary.txt")

mem = ranker.memory_usage_mb()
print(f"Memory before queries: {mem:.1f} MB")

queries = ["smb exploit", "log4j injection", "powershell bypass", "rdp bluekeep"]
for q in queries:
    from nlp import process_line
    _, terms = process_line("Q " + q)
    ranker.query(terms, top_n=5)

print(f"Memory after  queries: {ranker.memory_usage_mb():.1f} MB  (unchanged = OOM safe)")
```

**`lsa_build.py`**  
Streams all index shards into a `scipy.sparse` TF-IDF matrix (never a dense array). Applies sklearn's `TruncatedSVD` to compress to `n_components` latent dimensions. L2-normalises the resulting term and document matrices so cosine similarity reduces to a dot product at query time. Saves `term_matrix.npy` (V × k), `doc_matrix.npy` (N × k), `doc_ids.json`, and `words.json`.

**`lsa_ranker.py`**  
Loads the two numpy arrays at startup. Each query is a weighted average of the query terms' latent vectors, then a single matrix dot product against all document vectors produces cosine similarity scores. Memory usage is fixed at approximately `(V + N) × k × 4 bytes` regardless of query volume — for 300 components and the full corpus this is roughly 200 MB, and it never grows. This is the OOM management property described in the project proposal.

---

### Phase 3 — LDA topic modeling

**Prerequisite:** Phase 1 ingestion complete (`data/corpus/` must exist). Phase 2 and LSA are **not** required — `topic_model.py` reads corpus shards directly, not the inverted index.

**What this phase does:** Trains an LDA model over CVE descriptions to discover recurring vulnerability themes (e.g. memory corruption, authentication bypass, injection attacks) without any manual labelling. It uses its own `topic_tokenize()` preprocessing pipeline — deliberately separate from the index NLP — which skips stemming (so topic words stay readable), strips structured IDs like CVE-XXXX and CWE-NNN (which carry no topical meaning), and removes an extended list of CVE boilerplate words that survive standard stopword lists (`fix`, `call`, `make`, `prior`, `resolve`, etc.).

**Files involved:** `topic_model.py`

**Outputs:** `data/lda/lda_model`, `data/lda/topic_terms.json`, `data/lda/doc_topics.json`, `data/lda/coherence.txt`

```python
# Install gensim (needed for LDA only)
!pip install gensim
```

```python
# LDA topic modeling over CVE corpus
# --topics: number of latent topics to discover
# --passes: training iterations (more = better coherence score, slower)
!python topic_model.py --topics 20 --passes 10
```

```python
# Inspect discovered topics
import json
with open("data/lda/topic_terms.json") as f:
    topics = json.load(f)

for t in topics[:10]:
    terms = ", ".join(w["word"] for w in t["terms"][:8])
    print(f"Topic {t['topic_id']:02d}: {terms}")
```

```python
# Check coherence score (written to data/lda/coherence.txt)
# C_v above 0.5 = interpretable topics; above 0.6 = good
with open("data/lda/coherence.txt") as f:
    print(f.read())
```

```python
# Assign a query to its closest topic
!python topic_model.py --query "heap overflow privilege escalation kernel"
```

**`topic_model.py`**  
Trains an LDA model over CVE descriptions using gensim. Reads corpus shards from data/corpus/nvd_*.txt directly — the inverted index is not involved. Uses its own topic_tokenize() function that is deliberately separate from the index NLP pipeline: no stemming (so words stay readable as injection not inject), no structured IDs (CVE-XXXX and CWE-NNN are excluded as they carry no topical meaning), and an extended boilerplate stopword list targeting words common to almost every CVE description (fix, call, make, prior, resolve, etc.). Vocabulary is further filtered by filter_extremes — terms in fewer than 10 documents or more than 40% of documents are dropped. Writes topic_terms.json (top 15 words per topic with probability weights), doc_topics.json (dominant topic and confidence per CVE), and coherence.txt (C_v coherence score — above 0.5 indicates interpretable topics, above 0.6 is good). Also supports --query mode to assign new free-text to its closest topic without retraining.

### Phase 3 — Analysis and Evaluation framework

**Prerequisite:** Phase 2 complete (`data/index/doc_lengths.json` and `data/index/technique_cve_map.json` must exist). LSA index required if running `--scorer lsa` or `--scorer both`. `topic_model.py` must have been run (`data/lda/` must exist). The tactic heatmap additionally requires `data/index/technique_cve_map.json` (built by `expander.py build-map`).

**What this phase does:** Issues ATT&CK technique names as queries and measures retrieval quality for BM25 and LSA using the technique→CVE mappings as ground truth relevance labels. Produces a comparison table for the final report. Produces two complementary visualizations of the LDA topic model outputs, directly implementing the "threat-cluster visualization" stretch goal from the project proposal.

**Files involved:** `evaluate.py`, `visualize.py`

**Outputs:** `data/eval/eval_results.json`, `data/eval/eval_summary.csv`, `data/viz/topic_wordclouds.png`, `data/viz/tactic_heatmap.png`

```python
# Evaluate BM25 vs LSA (requires both Phase 2 and LSA index)
!python evaluate.py --scorer both --top-k 10

# BM25 only (if LSA index not yet built)
!python evaluate.py --scorer bm25 --top-k 10

# Adjust K for Precision@K and nDCG@K
!python evaluate.py --scorer both --top-k 5
```

```python
# View the summary CSV — paste this table directly into your report
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data/eval/eval_summary.csv")
print(df.to_string(index=False))
```
```python
# Install visualization dependencies
!pip install pyldavis wordcloud matplotlib scikit-learn
```

```python
# Step 2: Generate visualizations
!python visualize.py

# Or generate individually:
!python visualize.py --only wordclouds   # word clouds only
!python visualize.py --only heatmap      # tactic heatmap only
```
**What each visualization shows:**

| Output | What it shows | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `topic_wordclouds.png` | One word cloud per topic; word size = LDA weight | Quick overview of all topics at once |
| `tactic_heatmap.png` | ATT&CK kill-chain tactics × LDA topics; cell = CVE count | Connecting vulnerability themes to attack stages |

**`evaluate.py`**  
Evaluation framework. Uses the technique→CVE map from expander.py as ground truth: each ATT&CK technique name is issued as a query, and its mapped CVEs are the relevant documents. Computes Precision@K (fraction of top-K results that are relevant), MRR (reciprocal rank of the first relevant result), and nDCG@K (position-weighted relevance score) for both BM25 and LSA. Writes eval_results.json (per-query breakdown) and eval_summary.csv (aggregate comparison table for the report).

**`visualize.py`**  
Threat-cluster visualizations over the LDA outputs. (1) **Word clouds** — one per topic, word size proportional to LDA probability weight, rendered on a dark background for readability. (2) **Tactic heatmap** — matrix of ATT&CK kill-chain tactics (rows) × LDA topics (columns), cell value = CVE count; shows how vulnerability themes align with attack stages. The heatmap requires `technique_cve_map.json` and skips gracefully if it is absent. Uses the technique→CVE map from `expander.py` as ground truth: each ATT&CK technique name is issued as a query, and its mapped CVEs are the relevant documents. Computes Precision@K (fraction of top-K results that are relevant), MRR (reciprocal rank of the first relevant result), and nDCG@K (position-weighted relevance score) for both BM25 and LSA. Writes `eval_results.json` (per-query breakdown) and `eval_summary.csv` (aggregate comparison table for the report).

## Persisting Data Across Colab Sessions (Optional)

Colab sessions reset periodically. To avoid re-downloading and re-indexing:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Copy built index to Drive after Phase 1
import shutil
shutil.copytree('data/index',     '/content/drive/MyDrive/threatsearch/index')
shutil.copytree('data/lsa_index', '/content/drive/MyDrive/threatsearch/lsa_index')

# On next session, restore from Drive
shutil.copytree('/content/drive/MyDrive/threatsearch/index',     'data/index')
shutil.copytree('/content/drive/MyDrive/threatsearch/lsa_index', 'data/lsa_index')
```
